## Debugger and inspecting applications 
Debuggin node can be done using the chrome browser
due to the fact that chrom also runs on the V8 engione, google has added the ability to inspect and pause applications to see the variables and values wirthin an application. 

```js
debugger 
// To use a debugger, put 'inspect' before the script name 
// In thsi case it would be 'node inspect app.js --title="" --body=""'
```

To visit the debugger used by chrome, we can visit 
```chrome://inspect```
